Earlier this month, Redis Labs released the new [Redis Data Source](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/redis-datasource) for Grafana plug-in, which connects the widely used open source application monitoring tool to Redis. To give you an idea of how it all works, let’s take a look at a self-referential example: using the plug-in to see how many times it has been downloaded over time. (The Grafana plug-in repository itself does not provide such statistics out of the box.)

# What is the Redis Data Source for Grafana?

If you’re not familiar with Grafana, it’s a very popular tool used to build dashboards to monitor applications, infrastructures, and software components. The Redis Data Source for Grafana is a plug-in that allows users to connect to the Redis database and build dashboards in Grafana to easily monitor Redis data. It provides an out-of-the-box predefined dashboard, but also lets you build customized dashboards tuned to your specific needs.
